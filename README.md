# Jekyll Static Index Generator

Generate static index pages for your categories and tags, e.g. `http://example.com/categories/news`, `http://example.com/tags/rails`. This is useful if you are publishing to GitHub Pages, as they don't support plugins which can generate these index pages dynamically.

Run `jekyll build` to have the plugin create index pages for all your categories and tags. Then, add the `categories/` and `tags/` directories and push them to GitHub.
